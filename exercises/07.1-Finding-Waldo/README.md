# `07.1` Finding Waldo 😄

![Finding Waldo](../../.learn/assets/finding_waldo.jpeg)

Have you ever played "Where's Waldo?" I used to play it a lot when I was little, this exercise is a digital version of Where's Waldo.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Please loop this entire array and print the positions where the string "Waldo" is found.

## 💡 Hints:

+ You need to add a conditional inside the loop.

+ Waldo may be uppercase or lowercase, compare both values [using toLowerCase()](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/compare-the-case-insensitive-strings-in-javascript/)

## 🥚 Easter Egg:

+ What if there is more than one Waldo?
