# `07.1` Find Waldo :smile:

![Finding Waldo](../../.learn/assets/finding_waldo.jpeg)

Have you ever played finding Waldo? I used to play it a lot when I was little, this exercise is a digital version of finding Waldo.

## :pencil: Instructions:

1. Please loop this entire array and print the positions where the string "Waldo" is found.

### :bulb: Hint

+ You need to add a conditional inside the loop.

+ Waldo may be upper case or lowercase, compare both values [using toLowerCase()](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/compare-the-case-insensitive-strings-in-javascript/)

### :egg: Easter Egg:

What if there is more than one Waldo?
