# `21.3` Filter Array of Strings

## 📝 Instructions:

Given an array `names`, please create a function that filters only the names containing the given string.

1. Create a function called `filterByName` that accepts two values one is the array and the second one is the filter desire.

**The search should NOT be Case Sensitive.**

## 💡 Hint:

```js
 // Use any of the built in methods

 array.push();
 array.filter();
 string.includes();
 string.toLowerCase();
```
