# `17` The For Loop Find average

Another way to loop an array with the `for` loop will be using the `of` statement like this:

```js
for (let element of myArray){
    console.log(element);
}
```

The for-of loop gives you direct access to the elements (as seen above), without you having to use the format array[index] to access the value of an element. 

That makes this type of loop simpler to use, however it does not give you access to indexes, so if you will need to use the indexes of the elemenets, then you will not be able to use it.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Calculate the average value of all the items in the array 

2. Print it on the console.

### 💡 Hint:

+ To print the average, you have to add all the values and divide the result by the total length of the list.


### Expected result:

```js
27278.8125
```
