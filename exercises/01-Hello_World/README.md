# `01` Hello World

In JavaScript, we use `console.log()` to make the computer write anything we want (the content of a variable, a given string, etc.) in something called **the console**.

Every language has a console, as it was the only way to interact with the users at the beginning (before Windows or MacOS arrived). 

Today, printing in the console is mostly used as a monitoring tool, ideal for leaving a trace of the content of variables during program execution.

This is an example of how to use it:

```js
console.log("How are you?");
```

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Use `console.log()` to print "Hello World" on the console. Feel free to try other things as well.
