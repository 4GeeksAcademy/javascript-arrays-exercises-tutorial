# `15` Max integer from the array 


## 📝 Instructions:

1. Write a function `findMax` that finds the largest integer in any array that is passed to it as a parameter.

2. Print that largest integer in the console with the `console.log()` function.

## 💡 Hints:

- Define an auxiliary variable. What should its initial value be?

- Then compare the auxiliary variable with every number in the list.

- Replace the value of the auxiliary variable with that of every encountered number that is greater than the auxiliary.

- At the end, you will have the biggest number stored in the variable.


## 💻 Expected result:

```js
  console.log(findMax(myArray)); // prints 5435
```
