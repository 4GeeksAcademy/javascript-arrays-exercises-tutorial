# `20.5` Map array of objects

The most common scenario for the mapping function is for simplifying given arrays, for example:

The current algorithm creates an array with only the names of the people and prints it on the console.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Please update the mapping function so it creates an array where each item contains the following:

```js
Hello, my name is Joe and I am 36 years old
```

## 💡 Hint:

+ You have to get the age of each people based on their birthDate. 

+ Search in Google "How to get the age of given birth date in javascript".

+ Inside your simplifier function you have to return a concatenation.

## Expected result:

```js
[ 'Hello, my name is Joe and I am 36 years old',
  'Hello, my name is Bob and I am 47 years old',
  'Hello, my name is Erika and I am 33 years old',
  'Hello, my name is Dylan and I am 23 years old',
  'Hello, my name is Steve and I am 19 years old' ]
```
