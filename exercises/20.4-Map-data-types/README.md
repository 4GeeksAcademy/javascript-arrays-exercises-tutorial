# `20.4` Map data types

Some times arrays come with mixed values and you need to unify them into only one data type.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Update the `array.map()` function to make it create a new array that contains the data types of each corresponding item from the original array.

## 💡 Hint:

+ Use the `typeof` function to get the data type.
## Expected result:

```js
[string,string,... ,number,string,...]
```
