# `03` Print the last one

You will never know how many items `myStupidArray` has because it is being randomly generated during runtime using the `generateRandomArray` function.

But don't worry! The property `myStupidArray.length` returns the length of `myArray` (try console logging it and you will see the length displayed on the console).

```js
let totalItems = myStupidArray.length;
```

## 📝 Instructions

1. Create a variable named `theLastOne`, and assign it the LAST element of `myStupidArray`.

2. Then, print it on the console.
