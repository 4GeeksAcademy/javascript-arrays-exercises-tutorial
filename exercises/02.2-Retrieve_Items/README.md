# `02.2` Retrieve Items

The only way to access a particular element in an array is by using an index. An **index** is an integer number that represents the position you want to access in the array.

You need to wrap the index into brackets like this:

```js
let myValue = array[index];
```

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Print on the console the 1st element of the array

2. Print on the console the 4th element of the array
