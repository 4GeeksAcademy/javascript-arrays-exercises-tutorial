# `22` Matrix Builder

Matrix Rebuilding Coalitions

After some malicious code, mainly by Mr. Smith, the matrix has some gaping hole and it needs some help to rebuild. Create a matrix of random 0's and 1's based on a parameter.

## 📝 Instructions:

1. Create a function called `matrixBuilder`, which will expect 1 parameter (an integer). 
This number represents the amount of rows and columns for the matrix. 

Example: 5 means that the matrix should be `5 x 5`. 

2. This function should return an array of arrays that represents the matrix. Example: 3 should return:

```js
[
  [0, 1, 1],
  [1, 0, 1],
  [0, 0, 0]
]
```

**Remember that 0's and 1's must be random.**
