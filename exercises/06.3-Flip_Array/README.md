# `06.3` Flip Array

## 📝 Instructions: 
 
1. Using a `for` loop, invert the `arr` array and print the new array on the console. 

## Example:

```js
Initial array:  [45, 67, 87, 23, 5,  32, 60];
Final array:    [60, 32, 5 , 23, 87, 67, 45];
```

## 💡 Hints:

+ You should loop the entire array [from the end to the beggining](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1340589/are-loops-really-faster-in-reverse).

+ On each loop push all the items (as you go) into a new array, this will be your flipped array. What other methods can you use besides `push()`?
