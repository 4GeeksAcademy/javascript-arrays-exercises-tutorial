# `02.1` Access and Retrieve

Arrays are part of every programming language. They are the way to go when you want to have a "list of elements."

For example, we could have an array that stores the days of the week:

```js
let myArray = ['sunday','monday','tuesday','wednesday','thursday','friday','saturday'];
```
Every array has the following parts:

- *Items*: are the actual values inside on each position of the array.

- *Length*: is the size of the array, the number of items.

- *Index*: is the position of an element.

![How arrays work](../../.learn/assets/DbmSOHT.png?raw=true)

To access any item within the array you need to know its index (position). The index is an integer value that represents the position in which the element is located. 

**IMPORTANT: Every array starts from zero (0)!**

## 📝 Instructions

1. Using the `console.log` function, print the 3rd item from the array.

2. Change the value in the position where `thursday` is located to `null`.

3. Print that position.

## 💡 Hint:

 + Use `null` as a value and not as a string.
