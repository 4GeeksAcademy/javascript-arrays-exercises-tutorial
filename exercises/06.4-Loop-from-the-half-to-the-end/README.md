This loop is not looping at all... because the variables initialValue, stopValue and increasingValue are equal to zero.

Instructions
Change the value of those variables to make the loop print only the last half of the array.
Change nothing but the value of those 3 variables!

The result should be something like:
```bash
23
48
56432
55
23
25
12
```
